    "\n",
    "[OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://openstreetmap.org) represents a comprehensive, collaborative project aimed at creating a freely editable map of the world. This initiative is a testament to a global effort in gathering and sharing geospatial data on a scale that covers our environment's various aspects, such as streets, buildings, services, and land use, to name a few. At its core, OSM is supported by a community that exceeds 8 million registered users, contributing approximately 4 million updates every day. This data, which consists of over 7 billion nodes, facilitates a range of applications beyond mapping, including routing, geocoding, education, and research, significantly impacting humanitarian efforts and economic development.\n",

For example, we will explore how to fetch data for the around Stora Torget in Karlstad, Sweden using a place name query, which relies on the Nominatim Geocoding API for location lookups.\n",
